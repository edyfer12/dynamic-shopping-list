# dynamic-shopping-list

This webpage contains a shopping list that if a user enters a name of the item, the item then gets displayed as a list.
The user also has an ability to remove the item off the list as a feature if he or she does not want to go shopping for
that item or makes a mistake on what to choose. In addition, if the user enters an item and appear on the list, then
the search box should appear as an empty value so more input can be added.
